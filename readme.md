[Gatsby waves](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves) and [Code Surfer](https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer) repositories got deprecated / left behind, and are missing some 3rd party updates, so this fork extracted some of the functionality related to the waves storytelling helpers, migrated it to typescript, and updated dependencies.
